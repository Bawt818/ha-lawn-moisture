# Notice

This project is not ready to be used by anyone and may never be.


## What will it one day (maybe) do?

The idea is to make use of a variety of MY Home Assistant entities to estimate when the lawn becomes too wet to mow and when it's dry enough to resume mowing.

It uses currently uses pre-configured entity names and requires data from uncommon sensors such as solar panels.

The project may one day become configurable for anyone to use.

Or it may not.
